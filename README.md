ğŸ”­ For more than one and a half years, I was working at [Visense](https://www.visense.io/) as a working student. I was writing code for edge devices in C++ and Python, and also doing fullstack development with React and Node.js.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Deep Learning, algorithmic fairness, golang and entrepreneurship in general

ğŸ¥³ I enjoy participating in Hackathons and meeting new people
