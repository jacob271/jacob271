### Hi, I'm Jacob Schäfer 👋

I'm studying Computer Science (M.Sc.) at [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](https://hpi.de/) in Potsdam and I'm working at [krisenchat](https://krisenchat.de/).

**Projects I'm working on right now**

- **usiGrabber**: We make proteomics data accesible for data scientist through a unified database for metadata. We are a team of 5 students and part of the Chair for Data Analytics and Computational Statistics at HPI.
- **Security for Android Apps**: As part of a lecture on mobile security, we are working on an android note taking app.

**Some past projects/experiences I'm proud of**

- **Generative AI for [MEGA Gruppe](https://www.mega.de/)**: We implemented a RAG based chatbot for employees and customers of the MEGA Gruppe. We pitched our solution to SAP CEO Christian Klein and CTO Philipp Herzig.
- As part of the Advanced Machine Learning Seminar at HPI, I was exploring ways to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on MRI scans. My research focused on Variational Autoencoders and whether additionally using segmentation masks can help to preserve more relevant details of the scans.
- For more than one and a half years, I have been working at [Visense](https://www.visense.io/) as a working student. I was doing full-stack development with React and Node.js and also writing code for edge devices in C++ and Python.
- During my bachelor thesis, I explored ways to mitigate bias in skin lesion classification models. Check out the Repository below or visit this [GitHub-Page](https://jacob271.github.io/mitigating-bias-in-skin-lesion-classification-models/).
- In April 2023, we won the [informatiCup2023](https://informaticup.github.io/) - a national computer science competition organized by the German Informatics Society. We spent several months coming up with a theoretical approach, developing an implementation, evaluating it, writing a report, and preparing a 20-minute presentation. You can watch the presentation [here](https://youtu.be/mF_BXMs875I?feature=shared) and take a look at our code and report in the repository below.
