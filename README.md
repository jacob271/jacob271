### Hi, I'm Jacob SchÃ¤fer ðŸ‘‹

I'm studying IT-Systems Engineering (M.Sc.) at [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](https://hpi.de/) in Potsdam and I'm working at [krisenchat](https://krisenchat.de/).

**Projects I'm working on right now**

- As part of a lecture at HPI, we are developing a generative AI use case for [MEGA Gruppe](https://www.mega.de/) in a team of five students. The goal is to make their internal knowledge accessible via a chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation.
- As part of the Advanced Machine Learning Seminar at HPI, Iâ€™m exploring ways to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on MRI scans. Iâ€™m focusing on Variational Autoencoders and whether additionally using segmentation masks can help to preserve more relevant details of the scans.
<!-- - At TÃ©lÃ©com Paris Iâ€™m working on a small data science project in Python as part of the lecture: "Economics of Sustainable Development and IT" -->

**Some past projects/experiences I'm proud of**

- For more than one and a half years, I have been working at [Visense](https://www.visense.io/) as a working student. I was doing full-stack development with React and Node.js and also writing code for edge devices in C++ and Python.
- During my bachelor thesis, I explored ways to mitigate bias in skin lesion classification models. Check out the Repository below or visit this [GitHub-Page](https://jacob271.github.io/mitigating-bias-in-skin-lesion-classification-models/).
- In April 2023, we won the [informatiCup2023](https://informaticup.github.io/) - a national computer science competition organized by the German Informatics Society. We spent several months coming up with a theoretical approach, developing an implementation, evaluating it, writing a report, and preparing a 20-minute presentation. You can watch the presentation [here](https://youtu.be/mF_BXMs875I?feature=shared) and take a look at our code and report in the repository below.
